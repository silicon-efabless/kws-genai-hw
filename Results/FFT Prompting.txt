Generate a verilog module consisting of a de-serializer, pre-emphasis filter, hanning window, and 32-point Fast Fourier Transform using the following specifications in Verilog-2005:


Initialize filter_en, hanning_en, and FFT_en to 0;


De-serializer instructions: '''
Inputs:'
WS(1-bit): read data_in when true;
CLK(1-bit): clock;
data_in(1-bit): data to be read;
'
Function:'
create two 7-bit registers: registerN, registerP;
read data_in;
store bits in registerN;
when registerN full, change filter_en variable to true;
after calling pre-emphasis filter, store registerN in registerP, reset registerN and continue reading data;
'
'''


Pre-emphasis filter Instructions: '''
follow the instructions below when filter_en is true;
create 7-bit width 32-depth FIFO;
when 7-bit register full, use the following equation where x(n) is the registerN value and x(n-1) is the registerP value: y(n)=x(n)-(x(n-1)-x(n-1)/32);
if no registerP value, y(n) = x(n)-(x(n)-x(n)/32);
To divide by 32, shift all bits right 5 spaces;
store y(n) in FIFO;
change hanning_en to true;
'''


Hanning Window Instructions: '''
follow the instructions below when hanning_en is true;
once FIFO filled, use variable i to iterate through numbers 0 to 31;
for each value i, multiply FIFO row [i] by index [i] in hanning_num_list;
when i > 15, access index [i-16] in hanning_num_list;
store each value back into the same FIFO row;
hanning_num_list contains 16 values;
hanning_num_list: [0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.09, 0.16, 0.24, 0.33, 0.42, 0.53, 0.63, 0.72, 0.81, 0.88, 0.94, 0.98, 1];
once all FIFO values recalculated, set FFT_en to true;
'''


Fast Fourier Transform Instructions: '''
perform FFT function when FFT_en is true on posedge of clock;
FFT is fully pipelined(no specific latency requirements for each stage);
Keep twiddle factor precision to 8 bits in fixed point format(1 sign bit, 7 fractional bits);
Calculate twiddle factors within verilog code;
Perform FFT operations using CORDIC;
FFT has 5 stages;
To store results of each stage, alternate between 2 FIFOs;
If overflow, keep most significant bits;
Data is stored in 7-bit-width 32-depth FIFO;
to access value from FIFO, just read value from specific FIFO row;
Assume FIFO is already full;
Each set of data is fixed-point format(1 sign bit, 6 fractional bits);
Run FFT on posedge if fft_start is true;
Output should be stored in a new 7-bit-width 32-depth FIFO in fixed point format(1 sign bit, 6 fractional bits);
To write to output FIFO, access specific row and write value;
'''


Cordic Algorithm Details: '''
Input values are 7-bit fixed-point format(1 sign bit, 6 fractional bits);
Use 8 CORDIC iterations;
Operate CORDIC in vectoring mode;
All data created in middle stages should be represented the same as input;
Scaling factor should be handled explicitly by CORDIC;
Angles should be calculated within verilog;
During overflow, round to nearest representable value;
Only store real part of value;
Ignore imaginary part of value;
Factor CORDIC into FFT pipeline;
Do not use multiplication;
'''


Additional Instructions: '''
Add synchronous reset to verilog module;
Reset applies to all internal registers, FIFOs, and control signals;
When reset enabled, set all components mentioned above to 0;
Reset applies to output FIFO as well;
Entire design operates on 10 MHz clock;
take as many clock cycles as necessary for each stage;
If additional information necessary, tell me what information should be provided instead of generating the verilog module;
If FIFO overflow, overwrite previous values;
No need to report overflow;
read_ptr and write_ptr for any FIFO should wrap around once it reaches the end;
overflow instructions apply to all FIFOs;
Turn on enable signal for next stage only when data from previous stage properly stored;
If partial or no data recieved at any stage, enable reset signal for one clock cycle;
on reset, all enable signals are set to 0;
on reset, end all ongoing operations;
after reset, all operations restarted;
no stability checks necessary after restarting;
Do not use multiplication;
Make sure verilog script is completely functional and includes all FFT and CORDIC operations;
Do not make user write FFT Pipeline Stages and CORDIC Algorithm;
Generate FFT Pipeline and CORDIC Algorithm as part of verilog code;
Generate complete CORDIC algorithm in verilog;
